## Logging into osTicket

Log into the virtual machine that has the osTicket webserver installed and configured on it, and go type `localhost/osTicket`. You should find yourself on a page that looks like this:

![1  osticket landing page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d60b701f-c4de-47e6-9ad5-51d4f944fabb)

Click "Sign in" in the top right corner, then click "I'm an agent - sign in here", and use the credentials for the admin user you created when you installed osTicket to log into the admin tools for your helpdesk. You should land on a page that looks like this:

There are lots of options that suddenly appear on your screen, but the most important distinction to recognize is the difference between the **Agent Panel** and the **Admin Panel**. Switch between them by clicking the name in the top right corner of the screen, next to your name. You'll always either be in one or the other, and the name not currently shown is the panel you're in. (Since you'd click the name of the other one to switch to it.)

- The Agent Panel is where tickets are worked and everything relating to active, closed, and archived tickets is stored. There are also knowledge bases for procedures, and ways for agents to sort tickets and use the panel as an organizational tool to prioritize tickets for optimal workflows.
- The Admin Panel is where system administration takes place. Here, you can create roles, groups, departments, and modify settings relating to how tickets are created and the classifications of problems that can be included in a ticket. Only users with administrator permissions may access the admin panel.
